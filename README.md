# Klipper3D-Rotation-Distance-Calculator
My Little Project for my 3D Printer with Klipper to calculate the Rotation Distance

I have created 3 different versions of the rotation calculator.

A simple Python file that can be executed in the console.

An extended Python file, also for the console but in this version the user can only enter numbers and also the comma is automatically converted to a point.

And last but not least, a version with GUI, created with TKINTER. 

All raw files are uploaded and the release of the GUI exe file was created with auto-py-to-exe.
